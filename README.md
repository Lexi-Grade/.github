# LexiGrade

**LexiGrade** is an academic research organization focused on the development of **computational systems for language education**, with particular emphasis on **CEFR-aligned text processing, evaluation, and simplification**.

The organization hosts research-driven software projects that explore how linguistic theory, applied linguistics, and natural language processing can be integrated into **transparent, reproducible, and evaluation-oriented systems**.

---

## Research orientation

Projects under the LexiGrade organization share the following principles:

- Explicit control over **linguistic difficulty and CEFR levels**
- Separation between **generation** and **evaluation**
- Emphasis on **constraints, metrics, and failure analysis**
- Reproducibility and openness over managed or commercial solutions
- Academic alignment rather than product-oriented design

LexiGrade does **not** aim to replace teachers or pedagogical judgment.  
Instead, its systems are designed as **support tools** for research, experimentation, and informed pedagogical use.

## Scope of projects

Repositories in this organization may include:

- CEFR level estimation
- Text simplification systems aligned to CEFR  

Each repository contains its own technical documentation, usage instructions, and experimental details.

---

## Academic context

LexiGrade projects are developed in an **academic and experimental context**, often in parallel with:

- peer-reviewed articles  
- methodological discussions  
- reproducibility-oriented system design  

---

## Open science

All projects prioritize:

- open-source licensing  
- transparent system behavior  
- clear methodological documentation  

Cloud infrastructure, orchestration, and deployment strategies are intentionally left flexible, targeting **researchers and advanced users** rather than end consumers.
